<b> materials science research at NASA ARC </b>

Outside my lab at CU, I secured an internship in with the thermal protection materials (TSM) branch at Ames Research Center. Working as a material science researcher for 10 weeks, I was afforded the opportunity to explore new research for constructing more representative geometries for reentry vehicle heat shields on future NASA spacecraft, critical for entry, descent, and landing (EDL). Shown here is an automated processing routine developed and trained using Facebook's Detectron2's panoptic segmentation neural network. This research effort designed a way of composing a continuous voxel representation of yarns within a composite weave using consecutive CT scans of the material, capturing the variability in the material following production. A full report can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01265), and work is still ongoing to fully implement this work at NASA ARC.
