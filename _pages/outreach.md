<b> community outreach </b>

Outside my research, I am learning how knowledge of biomechanics and medicine help everyday individuals. I currently serve as a volunteer for Boulder Community Health a few hours a week, where I assist physical therapists in the CU Champions Center where they rehabilitate patients with orthopedic trauma.
