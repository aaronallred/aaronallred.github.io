My life experiences have provisioned me with a wealth of perspective and understanding that stems directly from working with, and learning from, individuals with unique backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives to my own. In academia, diversity is a source of innovation, a tributary that feeds the larger community with the creativity and insight required to tackle hard problems in new ways. When looking to establish a diverse cohort of instructors, students, and advisees, it is critical that we consider individuals’ personal journeys, upbringings, circumstances, and multidisciplinary skills as valuable contributors to the entirety of what they offer an academic institution. 

While assembling a diverse cohort is an initial stride towards a richer academic community, the cultivation of an inclusive culture, largely influenced by leadership, is equally imperative. Inclusivity means embracing the sources of individuals’ differences. In practice, all voices are not only heard but respected and addressed.  This approach facilitates the open exchange of ideas and perspectives, thereby empowering everyone to contribute meaningfully. Furthermore, fostering inclusivity requires advocating for others.

I firmly believe that instructors play a leadership role in the academic community and bear the responsibility of dismantling barriers to diversity and inclusion while using equity as a strategic tool to improve the status of disadvantaged groups. Subsequent to these principles, a sense of belonging in various academic settings (whether that be a class, project group, research lab, or in the break room) transforms an academic community into a comfortable environment and a home away from home. By actively selecting diverse applicants, providing an equitable and inclusive learning and research environment, and fostering community through belonging, I aim to make a positive impact by embodying the professional and personal values that I have obtained and will continue to refine for the duration of my academic career.
