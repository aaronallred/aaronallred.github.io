Concurrent with my dissertation work, my professional journey has involved working with the neuroscience laboratory at NASA Johnson Space Center where I have spent time developing countermeasures for sensorimotor impairment in astronauts as well as assessments to improve crew health and performance. This work has led to working first-hand with astronauts acquainted with the side-effects of spaceflight. Additionally, I am learning how knowledge of biomechanics and medicine help everyday individuals. I currently serve as a volunteer for Boulder Community Health a few hours a week, where I assist physical therapists in the CU Champions Center where they rehabilitate patients with orthopedic trauma.
