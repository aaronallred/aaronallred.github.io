<b> structural engineering at Boeing </b>

My professional career began in aerospace engineering as a structural engineer. After obtaining a BS in aerospace engineering at the University of Oklahoma, I joined Boeing in Oklahoma City, where I spent three years evaluating aircraft in the US Air Force fleet. 

My work at Boeing was focused on all things structural analysis: stress determining, crack growth, material selection, repair design, and probability of failure analysis. Here I got to work on aircraft such as the B-52 and B-1 (pictured below), but the most rewarding aspect of this work was benefiting pilots by providing structural safety during day-to-day operations.

<b> optimization at CU </b>

Leaving Boeing, I studied design and topology optimization under [Kurt Maute](https://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/kurt-maute) and [Alireza Doostan](https://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/alireza-doostan) at CU while concurrently pursuing my degree in Bioastronautics with [Torin Clark](https://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/torin-clark). Working in this group, I learned how to work with the PDEs describing fluids, structures, and materials (FSM) as well as advanced computational methods of analysis. Shown below is an example problem known as a 'force reverser,' where an optimal structure is found through topology optimization, based on an objective function that minimizes strain energy (i.e., maximizes stiffness) subject to multiple constraints on the final mass of the structure as well as desired displacements, which result in a force reversal.

<b> materials science research at NASA ARC </b>

Outside my lab at CU, I secured an internship in with the thermal protection materials (TSM) branch at Ames Research Center. Working as a material science researcher for 10 weeks, I was afforded the opportunity to explore new research for constructing more representative geometries for reentry vehicle heat shields on future NASA spacecraft, critical for entry, descent, and landing (EDL). Shown below is an automated processing routine developed and trained using Facebook's Detectron 2's panoptic segmentation neural network. This research effort designed a way of composing a continuous voxel representation of yarns within a composite weave using consecutive CT scans of the material, capturing the variability in the material following production. A full report can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01265), and work is still ongoing to fully implement this work at NASA ARC.

<b> bioastronautics PhD </b>

My dissertation work is in developing "A Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation-Based Countermeasure to Motion Sickness in Astronauts." This research endeavor has motivated a new [computational model of motion sickness](https://rdcu.be/djNx9), a computational model of how GVS influences self-motion perception (manuscript in preparation now), and an experiment where we are currently evaluating the efficacy of our GVS countermeasure to motion sickness. Broadly, the outcomes of this work have utility outside of aerospace in the autonomous car industry and across all modes of transportation. My PhD advisor at CU is Torin Clark, and the CU bioastronautics lab (shared by Allie Anderson, Katya Arquilla, Jim Nabity, and David Klaus) can be found [here](https://www.colorado.edu/bioastronautics/).

<b> NASA VTEs </b>

Alongside my dissertation work, my professional journey has involved working with the [neuroscience laboratory](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/esdmd/hhp/neuroscience/) at NASA Johnson Space Center where I have spent time developing countermeasures for sensorimotor impairment in astronauts as well as assessments to improve crew health and performance. This work has led to working first-hand with astronauts acquainted with the side-effects of spaceflight.

<b> community outreach </b>

Outside my research, I am learning how knowledge of biomechanics and medicine help everyday individuals. I currently serve as a volunteer for Boulder Community Health a few hours a week, where I assist physical therapists in the CU Champions Center where they rehabilitate patients with orthopedic trauma. Upon graduating with a PhD this spring, I plan to continue bioastronautics research in academia while working with industry partners to improve technologies and medical capabilities for deep space exploration.
