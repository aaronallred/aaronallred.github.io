MIT's late Larry Young describes bioastronautics in [the bioastronautics handbook](https://link.springer.com/referencework/10.1007/978-3-319-12191-8) as, "...the intersection of space science and technology with biology and human factors. It encompasses both human and nonhuman space life science, including astronaut performance, protection, and life support as well as the effect of space on biological processes."

As my friend and colleague Annika Rollock puts it in her [blog](https://www.annikarollock.com/blog/so-you-want-to-learn-about-bioastronautics), bioastronautics broadly encompasses everything from the physiology of the inner ear, cockpit and display design, materials for spacesuits, the effects of radiation on various cells and hardware, components of life support systems, and the processes for defining requirements and readying technologies. The umbrella of bioastronautics is propped open to combat the hazards of the space environment, which pose risks and impedances to human exploration. So what specifically about the space environment must we understand as engineers, scientists, and explorers?
