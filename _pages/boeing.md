<b> structural engineering at Boeing </b>

My professional career began in aerospace engineering as a structural engineer. After obtaining a BS in aerospace engineering at the University of Oklahoma, I joined Boeing in Oklahoma City, where I spent three years evaluating aircraft in the US Air Force fleet. 

My work at Boeing was focused on all things structural analysis: stress determining, crack growth, material selection, repair design, and probability of failure analysis. Here I got to work on aircraft such as the B-52 and B-1, but the most rewarding aspect of this work was benefiting pilots by providing structural safety during day-to-day operations.
