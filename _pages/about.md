Captivated by the expanse of space, I developed a lifelong passion for human exploration that has grown deeper with my furthered education, industry work, and personal experiences. Today, this passion has manifested as a desire to establish new capabilities and access to human exploration through research and to teach the next generation of aerospace students through a teaching program grounded in providing equitable access to learning.

<b>Overview<b>

Human exploration is in the midst of significant advance, necessitating new technologies for enabling pioneers and passengers on humanityâ€™s next endeavors. Essential to our success, these technologies must mitigate sensorimotor risks affecting human performance, health, and safety in the often-unforgiving domain of outer space. 

To realize these lofty goals, I perform research in the field of [bioastronautics](/bioastro/). My research experiences have given me the tools to formulate my own research program, which is grounded in aerospace engineering, neuroscience, and human factors.  I aim to advance neuroscience technologies motivated by spaceflight, ultimately benefiting astronauts, pilots, and individuals here on Earth. To realize this vision, my research examines three key thrusts, each uniting pioneering neuroscience research with novel spaceflight technologies:  

1. Developing and quantifying models of human sensory central processing 

2. Developing and evaluating spaceflight-relevant assessments of sensorimotor impairment 

3. Advancing pilot and astronaut pre-flight training to achieve improved performance and safety

Outside of my work, I enjoy trail running, hiking, reading (lately mostly Sanderson), and traveling.
