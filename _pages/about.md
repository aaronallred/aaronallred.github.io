Human exploration is in the midst of significant advance, necessitating new technologies for enabling pioneers and passengers on humanityâ€™s next endeavors. Essential to our success, these technologies must mitigate sensorimotor risks affecting human performance, health, and safety in the often-unforgiving domain of outer space. This pursuit is underpinned by a research program grounded in neuroscience, human factors, and aerospace engineering, driven by an enduring passion for furthering human exploration. 

In researching bioastronautics, I aim to advance neuroscience technologies motivated by spaceflight, ultimately benefiting astronauts, pilots, and individuals here on Earth. To realize this vision, my research examines three key thrusts, each uniting pioneering neuroscience research with novel spaceflight technologies: 

developing and quantifying models of human sensory central processing 

developing and evaluating spaceflight-relevant assessments of sensorimotor impairment, and 

advancing pilot and astronaut pre-flight training to achieve improved operational performance and safety.
