Captivated by the expanse of space, I developed a lifelong passion for human exploration that has grown deeper with my furthered education, industry work, and personal experiences. Today, this passion has manifested as a desire to establish new capabilities and access to human exploration through research and to teach the next generation of aerospace students through a teaching program grounded in providing equitable access to learning.

<b>Overview<b>

Human exploration is in the midst of significant advance, necessitating new technologies for enabling pioneers and passengers on humanityâ€™s next endeavors. Essential to our success, these technologies must mitigate sensorimotor and behavioral risks affecting human performance, health, and safety in the often-unforgiving domain of outer space. 

To realize these goals, I perform research in the field of [bioastronautics](/bioastro/). My research experiences have given me the tools to formulate my own research program, which is rests at the interesection of aerospace engineering and neuroscience - pairing engineering and space life science.  My work advances and engineers neuroscience technologies motivated by spaceflight, ultimately benefiting astronauts, pilots, and individuals here on Earth. My research examines four key thrusts, each uniting neuroscience research with spaceflight motivated technologies: 

1. Developing and quantifying models of human sensory central processing 

2. Developing and evaluating spaceflight-relevant sensorimotor assessments and countermeasures

3. Advancing pilot and astronaut training analogs

4. Countering behavioral risks and decision-making deficits due to isolated, confined, and extreme (ICE) environmental factors

You can stay up to date on my publications [here](/publications/) or on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SIgYus9q4TIC&hl=en&oi=ao), and you can reach me at the email linked below if you are interested in collaborating on related areas of research!

Outside of my work, I enjoy trail running, hiking, reading (lately mostly Sanderson), and traveling.
