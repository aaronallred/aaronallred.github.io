<b> optimization at CU </b>

Leaving Boeing, I studied design and topology optimization under [Kurt Maute](https://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/kurt-maute) and [Alireza Doostan](https://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/alireza-doostan) at CU while concurrently pursuing my degree in Bioastronautics with [Torin Clark](https://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/torin-clark). Working in this group, I learned how to work with the PDEs describing fluids, structures, and materials (FSM) as well as advanced computational methods of analysis. Shown below is an example problem known as a 'force reverser,' where an optimal structure is found through topology optimization, based on an objective function that minimizes strain energy (i.e., maximizes stiffness) subject to multiple constraints on the final mass of the structure as well as desired displacements, which result in a force reversal.
