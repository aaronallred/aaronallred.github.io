<b> bioastronautics PhD </b>

My dissertation work is in developing "A Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation-Based Countermeasure to Motion Sickness in Astronauts." This research endeavor has motivated a new [computational model of motion sickness](https://rdcu.be/djNx9), a computational model of how GVS influences self-motion perception (manuscript in preparation now), and an experiment where we are currently evaluating the efficacy of our GVS countermeasure to motion sickness. Broadly, the outcomes of this work have utility outside of aerospace in the autonomous car industry and across all modes of transportation. My PhD advisor at CU is Torin Clark, and the CU bioastronautics lab (shared by Allie Anderson, Katya Arquilla, Jim Nabity, and David Klaus) can be found [here](https://www.colorado.edu/bioastronautics/).
