<b> NASA VTEs </b>

Alongside my dissertation work, my professional journey has involved working with the [neuroscience laboratory](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/esdmd/hhp/neuroscience/) at NASA Johnson Space Center where I have spent time developing countermeasures for sensorimotor impairment in astronauts as well as assessments to improve crew health and performance. This work has led to working first-hand with astronauts acquainted with the side-effects of spaceflight.
