	abstract = {This effort seeks to further assess human perception of self-motion by quantifying and comparing earth-vertical rotational vestibular perceptual thresholds about the yaw, roll, and pitch axes. Early seminal works (Benson Aviat Space Environ Med 60:205–213, 1989) quantified thresholds for yaw, roll, and pitch rotations, using single-cycle sinusoids in angular acceleration with a frequency of 0.3 Hz (3.33 s motion duration) and found yaw thresholds to be significantly lower than roll and pitch thresholds (1.58–1.20 deg/s vs. 2.07 deg/s and 2.04 deg/s, respectively). Our current effort uses modern methods and definitions to reassess if rotational thresholds differ between these three axes of rotation in ten human subjects at 0.3 Hz and additionally across a range of frequencies: 0.1 Hz, 0.3 Hz, and 0.5 Hz. In contrast to the established findings of Benson et al., no statistically significant differences were found between the three rotational axes at 0.3 Hz. Further, no statistically significant differences were found at any of these frequencies. Instead, a consistent pattern was found for yaw, pitch, and roll of increasing thresholds with decreasing rotational frequency, consistent with the brain employing high-pass filter mechanisms for decision-making. We also fill a gap in the literature by extending the quantification of pitch rotation thresholds to 0.1 Hz. Finally, we assessed inter-individual trends between these three frequencies and across all three axes of rotation. In thoroughly considering methodological and other differences between the current and previous studies, we conclude yaw rotation thresholds do not differ from those in roll or pitch.},

	abstract = {Transitioning between gravitational environments results in a central reinterpretation of sensory information, producing an adapted sensorimotor state suitable for motor actions and perceptions in the new environment. Critically, this central adaptation is not instantaneous, and complete adaptation may require weeks of prolonged exposure to novel environments. To mitigate risks associated with the lagging time course of adaptation (e.g., spatial orientation misperceptions, alterations in locomotor and postural control, and motion sickness), it is critical that we better understand sensorimotor states during adaptation. Recently, efforts have emerged to model human perception of orientation and self-motion during sensorimotor adaptation to new gravity stimuli. While these nascent computational frameworks are well suited for modeling exposure to novel gravitational stimuli, they have yet to distinguish how the central nervous system (CNS) reinterprets sensory information from familiar environmental stimuli (i.e., readaptation). Here, we present a theoretical framework and resulting computational model of vestibular adaptation to gravity transitions which captures the role of implicit memory. This advancement enables faster readaptation to familiar gravitational stimuli, which has been observed in repeat flyers, by considering vestibular signals dependent on the new gravity environment, through Bayesian inference. The evolution and weighting of hypotheses considered by the CNS is modeled via a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter algorithm. Sensorimotor adaptation learning is facilitated by retaining a memory of past harmonious states, represented by a conditional state transition probability density function, which allows the model to consider previously experienced gravity levels (while also dynamically learning new states) when formulating new alternative hypotheses of gravity. In order to demonstrate our theoretical framework and motivate future experiments, we perform a variety of simulations. These simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of this model and its potential to advance our understanding of transitory states during which central reinterpretation occurs, ultimately mitigating the risks associated with the lagging time course of adaptation to gravitational environments.},

	abstract = {Entry motion sickness (EMS) affects crewmembers upon return to Earth following extended adaptation to microgravity. Anticholinergic pharmaceuticals (e.g., Meclizine) are often taken prior to landing; however, they have operationally adverse side effects (e.g., drowsiness). There is a need to develop non-pharmaceutical countermeasures to EMS. We assessed the efficacy of a technological countermeasure providing external visual cues following splashdown, where otherwise only nauseogenic internal cabin visual references are available. Our countermeasure provided motion-congruent visual cues of an Earth-fixed scene in virtual reality, which was compared to a control condition with a head-fixed fixation point in virtual reality in a between-subject design with 15 subjects in each group. We tested the countermeasure’s effectiveness at mitigating motion sickness symptoms at the end of a ground-based reentry analog: approximately 1 h of 2Gx centrifugation followed by up to 1 h of wave-like motion. Secondarily, we explored differences in vestibular-mediated balance performance between the two conditions. While Motion Sickness Questionnaire outcomes did not differ detectably between groups, we found significantly better survival rates (with dropout dictated by reporting moderate nausea consecutively over 2 min) in the visual countermeasure group than the control group (79\% survival vs. 33\%, t(14) = 2.50, p = 0.027). Following the reentry analogs, subjects demonstrated significantly higher sway prior to recovery (p = 0.0004), which did not differ between control and countermeasure groups. These results imply that providing motion-congruent visual cues may be an effective mean for curbing the development of moderate nausea and increasing comfort following future space missions.},
