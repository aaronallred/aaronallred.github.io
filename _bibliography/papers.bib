	abstract = {Per sensory conflict theory, vestibular sensory information has been proposed to drive motion sickness given deviations from central expectations. However, the consistency of motion sickness with quantitative predictions of manipulated vestibular sensory conflict remains untested. Here, we evaluated motion sickness symptoms within 10 participants exposed to galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) designed to manipulate vestibular sensory conflict during passive physical translations. Using a computational methodology, equal and opposite GVS waveforms were designed to reduce (Beneficial) or increase (Detrimental) motion sickness while controlling all other sources of sensory information and central confounds. Beneficial GVS produced a 26% motion sickness reduction, and Detrimental GVS produced a 56% increase (p = 0.0055), demonstrating the causal role of vestibular information in human motion sickness. Validating our predictions, this finding supports the theory that vestibular sensory conflict mediates motion sickness and facilitates new methods and countermeasures for mitigating motion sickness during transportation and in virtual environments.},

	abstract = {This effort seeks to further assess human perception of self-motion by quantifying and comparing earth-vertical rotational vestibular perceptual thresholds about the yaw, roll, and pitch axes. Early seminal works (Benson Aviat Space Environ Med 60:205–213, 1989) quantified thresholds for yaw, roll, and pitch rotations, using single-cycle sinusoids in angular acceleration with a frequency of 0.3 Hz (3.33 s motion duration) and found yaw thresholds to be significantly lower than roll and pitch thresholds (1.58–1.20 deg/s vs. 2.07 deg/s and 2.04 deg/s, respectively). Our current effort uses modern methods and definitions to reassess if rotational thresholds differ between these three axes of rotation in ten human subjects at 0.3 Hz and additionally across a range of frequencies: 0.1 Hz, 0.3 Hz, and 0.5 Hz. In contrast to the established findings of Benson et al., no statistically significant differences were found between the three rotational axes at 0.3 Hz. Further, no statistically significant differences were found at any of these frequencies. Instead, a consistent pattern was found for yaw, pitch, and roll of increasing thresholds with decreasing rotational frequency, consistent with the brain employing high-pass filter mechanisms for decision-making. We also fill a gap in the literature by extending the quantification of pitch rotation thresholds to 0.1 Hz. Finally, we assessed inter-individual trends between these three frequencies and across all three axes of rotation. In thoroughly considering methodological and other differences between the current and previous studies, we conclude yaw rotation thresholds do not differ from those in roll or pitch.},

	abstract = {Transitioning between gravitational environments results in a central reinterpretation of sensory information, producing an adapted sensorimotor state suitable for motor actions and perceptions in the new environment. Critically, this central adaptation is not instantaneous, and complete adaptation may require weeks of prolonged exposure to novel environments. To mitigate risks associated with the lagging time course of adaptation (e.g., spatial orientation misperceptions, alterations in locomotor and postural control, and motion sickness), it is critical that we better understand sensorimotor states during adaptation. Recently, efforts have emerged to model human perception of orientation and self-motion during sensorimotor adaptation to new gravity stimuli. While these nascent computational frameworks are well suited for modeling exposure to novel gravitational stimuli, they have yet to distinguish how the central nervous system (CNS) reinterprets sensory information from familiar environmental stimuli (i.e., readaptation). Here, we present a theoretical framework and resulting computational model of vestibular adaptation to gravity transitions which captures the role of implicit memory. This advancement enables faster readaptation to familiar gravitational stimuli, which has been observed in repeat flyers, by considering vestibular signals dependent on the new gravity environment, through Bayesian inference. The evolution and weighting of hypotheses considered by the CNS is modeled via a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter algorithm. Sensorimotor adaptation learning is facilitated by retaining a memory of past harmonious states, represented by a conditional state transition probability density function, which allows the model to consider previously experienced gravity levels (while also dynamically learning new states) when formulating new alternative hypotheses of gravity. In order to demonstrate our theoretical framework and motivate future experiments, we perform a variety of simulations. These simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of this model and its potential to advance our understanding of transitory states during which central reinterpretation occurs, ultimately mitigating the risks associated with the lagging time course of adaptation to gravitational environments.},

Anticholinergic pharmaceuticals (e.g., Meclizine) are often taken prior to landing; however, they have operationally adverse side effects (e.g., drowsiness). There is a need to develop non-pharmaceutical countermeasures to EMS. We assessed the efficacy of a technological countermeasure providing external visual cues following splashdown, where otherwise only nauseogenic internal cabin visual references are available. Our countermeasure provided motion-congruent visual cues of an Earth-fixed scene in virtual reality, which was compared to a control condition with a head-fixed fixation point in virtual reality in a between-subject design with 15 subjects in each group. We tested the countermeasure’s effectiveness at mitigating motion sickness symptoms at the end of a ground-based reentry analog: approximately 1 h of 2Gx centrifugation followed by up to 1 h of wave-like motion. Secondarily, we explored differences in vestibular-mediated balance performance between the two conditions. While Motion Sickness Questionnaire outcomes did not differ detectably between groups, we found significantly better survival rates (with dropout dictated by reporting moderate nausea consecutively over 2 min) in the visual countermeasure group than the control group (79\% survival vs. 33\%, t(14) = 2.50, p = 0.027). Following the reentry analogs, subjects demonstrated significantly higher sway prior to recovery (p = 0.0004), which did not differ between control and countermeasure groups. These results imply that providing motion-congruent visual cues may be an effective mean for curbing the development of moderate nausea and increasing comfort following future space missions.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION:
              Following a transition from microgravity to a gravity-rich environment (e.g., Earth, Moon, or Mars), astronauts experience sensorimotor impairment, primarily from a reinterpretation of vestibular cues, which can impact their ability to perform mission-critical tasks.
 To enable future exploration-class missions, the development of lightweight, space-conscious assessments for astronauts transitioning between gravity environments without expert assistance is needed.
              METHODS:
              We examined differences in performance during a two-dimensional (2D) hand–eye
 multidirectional tapping task, implemented in augmented reality in subjects (
              N
              = 20) with and without the presence of a vestibular-dominated sensorimotor impairment paradigm: the binaural bipolar application of a pseudorandom galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) signal. Metrics associated
 with both the impairment paradigm and task performance were assessed.
              RESULTS:
              Medial-lateral sway during balance on an anterior-posterior sway-referenced platform with eyes closed was most affected by GVS (effect size: 1.2), in addition to anterior-posterior sway (effect size: 0.63)
 and the vestibular index (effect size: 0.65). During the augmented reality task, an increase in time to completion (effect size: 0.63), number of misses (effect size: 0.52), and head linear accelerations (effect size: 0.30) were found in the presence of the selected GVS waveform.
              DISCUSSION:
              Findings indicate that this multidirectional tapping task may detect emergent vestibular-dominated impairment (near landing day performance) in astronauts. Decrements in speed and accuracy indicate this impairment may hinder crews’ ability to acquire known target locations while in a
 static standing posture. The ability to track these decrements can support mission operations decisions.

	abstract = {Predicting the time course of motion sickness symptoms enables the evaluation of provocative stimuli and the development of countermeasures for reducing symptom severity. In pursuit of this goal, we present an Observer-driven model of motion sickness for passive motions in the dark. Constructed in two stages, this model predicts motion sickness symptoms by bridging sensory conflict (i.e., differences between actual and expected sensory signals) arising from the Observer model of spatial orientation perception (stage 1) to Oman’s model of motion sickness symptom dynamics (stage 2; presented in 1982 and 1990) through a proposed “Normalized Innovation Squared” statistic. The model outputs the expected temporal development of human motion sickness symptom magnitudes (mapped to the Misery Scale) at a population level, due to arbitrary, 6-degree-of-freedom, self-motion stimuli. We trained model parameters using individual subject responses collected during fore-aft translations and off-vertical axis of rotation motions. Improving on prior efforts, we only used datasets with experimental conditions congruent with the perceptual stage (i.e., adequately provided passive motions without visual cues) to inform the model. We assessed model performance by predicting an unseen validation dataset, producing a Q2 value of 0.91. Demonstrating this model’s broad applicability, we formulate predictions for a host of stimuli, including translations, earth-vertical rotations, and altered gravity, and we provide our implementation for other users. Finally, to guide future research efforts, we suggest how to rigorously advance this model (e.g., incorporating visual cues, active motion, responses to motion of different frequency, etc.).},

	abstract = {Astronaut sensorimotor impairment is a concern for human spaceflight missions, particularly during and immediately following gravity transitions. When astronauts transition back to a gravitational environment following microgravity exposure, they commonly experience two types of vestibular self-motion illusions termed the tilt-gain and tilttranslation illusions. These vestibular illusions occur when astronauts tilt their heads relative to gravity and result in a sense of tilt over-estimation and/or an illusory sense of translation. This may lead to an improper perception of self or vehicle orientation which may impact functional task performance and vehicle operation. To address this risk, training tools must be developed to prepare astronauts for the vestibular illusions they will encounter post-spaceflight. Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) has been shown to produce illusions of tilt and degrade the performance of functional tasks by artificially stimulating the vestibular system. It still remains unclear, however, how well GVS can mimic the vestibular illusions experienced by astronauts post-spaceflight. In support of developing a training tool that can accurately mimic post-flight illusions, this study attempts to systematically quantify the magnitude of orientation perception alteration and the prevalence of side effects experienced during GVS.},

Following extended durations in microgravity, an astronaut’s central processing of vestibular signals is no longer conditioned to expect gravity cues, resulting in “sensory conflict” when exposed to Earth gravity. This conflict results in motion sickness symptoms such as vertigo, difficulty concentrating, and nausea, which are then likely exacerbated by the sea-state motion during water landings as astronauts await recovery. Motion sickness poses an operational hazard for astronauts should an off-nominal situation arise requiring quick action or emergency egress. Pharmaceuticals such as scopolamine are effective in mitigating motion sickness symptoms, but between side effects such as drowsiness and concerns about stability and shelf-life for long-duration missions, they are an imperfect solution.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION:
              Spatial disorientation (SD) remains the leading contributor to Class A mishaps in the U.S. Navy, consistent with historical trends. Despite this, SD training for military aircrew is largely confined to the classroom and experiential training replicating SD illusions
 is limited and infrequent. Static flight simulators are most commonly used for training but offer no vestibular stimulation to the flight crew, omitting the source of vestibular-mediated SD.
              BACKGROUND:
              We first cover vestibular-mediated SD illusions which may be replicated through
 galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) in a static environment. GVS is a safe, reliable, low-cost avenue for providing vestibular sensory stimulation. We review the underlying mechanisms of GVS such as the excitement and inhibition of the afferent neurons innervating the vestibular system,
 particularly in the binaural bipolar electrode montage.
              APPLICATIONS:
              Two approaches for how GVS may be used to enhance SD training are examined. The first is a means for providing unreliable vestibular sensory perceptions to pilots, and the second details how GVS can be leveraged
 for replicating vestibular-mediated SD illusions.
              DISCUSSION:
              We recommend GVS be pursued as an enhancement to existing SD training. The ability to disorient aircrew in the safe training environment of a static flight simulator would allow for aircrew familiarization to SD, serving
 as an opportunity to practice life-saving checklist items to recover from SD. A repeatable training profile that could be worn by military aircrew in a static flight simulator may afford a low-cost training solution to the number one cause of fatalities in military aviation.

However, the extent of GVS’s influence on the perception of self-orientation pathways is not understood, particularly in the presence of physical motions. Here, we quantify roll tilt perception impacted by GVS during passive whole-body roll tilts in humans (N = 11). We find that GVS systematically amplifies and attenuates perceptions of roll tilt during physical tilt, dependent on the GVS waveform. Subsequently, we develop a novel computational model that predicts 6DoF self-motion and self-orientation perceptions for any GVS waveform and motion by modeling the vestibular afferent neuron dynamics modulated by GVS in conjunction with an observer central processing model. This effort provides a means to systematically alter spatial orientation perceptions using GVS during concurrent physical motion, and we find that irregular afferent dynamics alone best describe resultant perceptions.},

	abstract = {During spaceflight operations, astronauts experience sensorimotor deficits, including spatial disorientation and motion sickness, upon transitioning from Earth to a microgravity environment and upon returning to Earth following extended exposure to microgravity. Resulting outcomes are often severe, and associated risks dictate operations in the first few days following a gravity transition. Before central adaptation to new patterns of sensory information is complete, the central nervous system does not correctly expect/interpret vestibular cues in the new gravity environment, commonly resulting in altered spatial orientation perceptions and, per sensory conflict theory, motion sickness. In recent years, our understanding of how gravity transitions lead to altered spatial orientation perception, sensory conflicts, and motion sickness has grown. Today, new computational models of human spatial orientation perception have been formulated, which enable quantitative predictions of spatial orientation and motion sickness that is preceded by sensory conflict resulting from gravity transitions. Leveraging these advanced models, we explore the utility of a technological countermeasure to spatial disorientation and motion sickness via the application of galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS). GVS uses low levels of electrical stimulation to alter vestibular sensory cues, and as a byproduct, augment perceptions and sensory conflicts. Leveraging current understandings of GVS and sensory conflict theory, the effectiveness of GVS as a motion sickness countermeasure in the terrestrial environment was first assessed. Preliminary results indicate that GVS can reduce motion sickness symptoms in the presence of a provocative physical stimulus. Here, this work is extended to computationally assess the effectiveness of GVS in altering spatial orientation perceptions following gravity transitions and discuss the implications of utilizing GVS as a countermeasure to motion sickness in astronauts. To accomplish this, an observer model of human perception following a gravity transition is combined with a model of vestibular sensory modulation from GVS. Spatial orientation perceptions are predicted to be more influenced by GVS following adaptation to microgravity, dependent on the magnitude of gravity of the new environment. These results, and their implications concerning GVS as a countermeasure to motion sickness, are discussed.},
